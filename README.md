# NLP-Sentiment-Analysis
This project performs sentiment analysis on text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically leveraging BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a state-of-the-art pre-trained language model developed by Google. The goal of the project is to classify the sentiment of textual data into categories such as positive, negative, or neutral.
## Overview
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. In this project, we use BERT, which is a powerful transformer-based model capable of capturing contextual information effectively, making it well-suited for NLP tasks like sentiment analysis.

## Features

- Utilizes BERT for sentiment analysis, providing accurate predictions by understanding the context of the text.
- Supports classification into multiple sentiment categories, such as positive, negative, and neutral.
- Pre-processing of text data including tokenization, padding, and attention mask generation.
- Fine-tuning of the pre-trained BERT model on custom sentiment analysis datasets for improved performance on specific tasks.

## Installation

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-nlp-bert.git


1.Install the required dependencies:


cd sentiment-analysis-nlp-bert
pip install -r requirements.txt

Download pre-trained BERT model weights (if not included in the repository).

Run the sentiment analysis script with your own data.

#Usage
To perform sentiment analysis using BERT:

1.Prepare your text data in a suitable format.
2.Fine-tune the pre-trained BERT model on your dataset (optional).
3.Use the trained model to predict sentiment on new text data.
